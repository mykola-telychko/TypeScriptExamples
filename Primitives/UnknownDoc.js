// Unknown
// Unknown is one of those types that once it clicks, you
// can find quite a lot of uses for it. It acts like a sibling
// to the any type. Where any allows for ambiguity - unknown
// requires specifics.
// A good example would be in wrapping a JSON parser. JSON
// data can come in many different forms and the creator
// of the json parsing function won't know the shape of the
// data - the person calling that function should.
var jsonParser = function (jsonString) { return JSON.parse(jsonString); };
var myAccount = jsonParser("{ \"name\": \"Dorothea\" }");
myAccount.name;
myAccount.email;
// If you hover on jsonParser, you can see that it has the
// return type of any, so then does myAccount. It's possible
// to fix this with generics - but it's also possible to fix
// this with unknown.
var jsonParserUnknown = function (jsonString) { return JSON.parse(jsonString); };
var myOtherAccount = jsonParserUnknown("{ \"name\": \"Samuel\" }");
myOtherAccount.name;
var myUserAccount = jsonParserUnknown("{ \"name\": \"Samuel\" }");
myUserAccount.name;
// Unknown is a great tool, to understand it more read these:

// Never
// Because TypeScript supports code flow analysis, the language
// needs to be able to represent when code logically cannot
// happen. For example, this function cannot return:
var neverReturns = function () {
    // If it throws on the first line
    throw new Error("Always throws, never returns");
};
// If you hover on the type, you see it is a () => never
// which means it should never happen. These can still be
// passed around like other values:
var myValue = neverReturns();
// Having a function never return can be useful when dealing
// with the unpredictability of the JavaScript runtime and
// API consumers that might not be using types:
var validateUser = function (user) {
    if (user) {
        return user.name !== "NaN";
    }
    // According to the type system, this code path can never
    // happen, which matches the return type of neverReturns.
    return neverReturns();
};
// The type definitions state that a user has to be passed in
// but there are enough escape valves in JavaScript whereby
// you can't guarantee that.
// Using a function which returns never allows you to add
// additional code in places which should not be possible.
// This is useful for presenting better error messages,
// or closing resources like files or loops.
// A very popular use for never, is to ensure that a
// switch is exhaustive. E.g., that every path is covered.
// Here's an enum and an exhaustive switch, try adding
// a new option to the enum (maybe Tulip?)
var Flower;
(function (Flower) {
    Flower[Flower["Rose"] = 0] = "Rose";
    Flower[Flower["Rhododendron"] = 1] = "Rhododendron";
    Flower[Flower["Violet"] = 2] = "Violet";
    Flower[Flower["Daisy"] = 3] = "Daisy";
})(Flower || (Flower = {}));
var flowerLatinName = function (flower) {
    switch (flower) {
        case Flower.Rose:
            return "Rosa rubiginosa";
        case Flower.Rhododendron:
            return "Rhododendron ferrugineum";
        case Flower.Violet:
            return "Viola reichenbachiana";
        case Flower.Daisy:
            return "Bellis perennis";
        default:
            var _exhaustiveCheck = flower;
            return _exhaustiveCheck;
    }
};
// If you look at the type for NeverIsRemoved, you see that
// it is string | number. This is because it should never
// happen at runtime because you cannot assign to it.
// This feature is used a lot in example:conditional-types
